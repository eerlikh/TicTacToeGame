User story:

After clicking the start button and selecting single or multiplayer,
I want to be able to start a game of tic tac toe,
so I can enjoy a game with a friend.

After starting the game,
I want the UI to be clear and easy to understand,
so people can enjoy the game without trying to figure out how it works.

As a player clicks a box on the grid,
I want to be able to show an X or O based on the player,
so I can keep track of who is doing what in the game.

If a player clicks on a box on the grid that already has a class,
I want to alert the player to go somewhere else,
so that I can make sure the rules of the game are followed so that game can progress.

If a player gets three X's or O's on the grid,
I want to display a victory message and congratulate them and offer the two players to play again,
so I can reward the players for their effort and give them another chance to battle to the death...
